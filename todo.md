# Project Improvement Plan (TODO)

This document lists the key areas for improvement to make the project more robust, maintainable, and reliable.

- [ ] **1. Implement a Comprehensive Testing Suite**
    - [ ] Create a `tests/` directory in the project root.
    - [ ] Add unit tests for the scoring and calculation logic in `src/analysis.py`.
    - [ ] Add unit tests for the record-finding logic in `src/records.py`.
    - [ ] Add unit tests for the data loading and fallback logic in `src/data_loader.py`.

- [x] **2. Add Docstrings and Improve Documentation**
    - [ ] Add comprehensive docstrings to all functions in the `src/` directory (`analysis.py`, `records.py`, `ui.py`, etc.). Each docstring should explain the function's purpose, its parameters, and what it returns.
    - [ ] Add inline comments for any complex or non-obvious lines of code.

- [ ] **3. Refactor UI for Reusability (DRY)**
    - [ ] Identify repeated UI-generation code across `Home.py` and the files in `pages/`.
    - [ ] Abstract common UI elements (e.g., page setup, sidebar configuration, date selectors) into reusable functions in `src/ui.py`.

- [ ] **4. Enhance UI Error Handling**
    - [ ] Add defensive checks in the UI code (`Home.py`, `pages/*.py`) to gracefully handle unexpected data states (e.g., empty DataFrames, `None` values) returned from the analysis functions.
    - [ ] Display user-friendly messages or placeholders instead of crashing when data is unavailable.
