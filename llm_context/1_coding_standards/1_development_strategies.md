# Development Strategies

These are practical strategies to apply during the development process.

*   **Modularity:** The project is structured into modules with specific responsibilities (e.g., `data_loader`, `analysis`). This separation of concerns should be maintained and extended.
*   **Readability:** Write clean, well-structured code. Use meaningful names for variables and functions, and follow consistent formatting.
*   **Error Handling & Resilience:** The application must be robust. It should anticipate potential failures (e.g., network issues, missing files) and handle them gracefully without crashing.
    *   **Fail Fast:** Report errors as soon as they are detected by raising exceptions immediately. This prevents the system from continuing in an invalid state and makes debugging easier.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   **Docstrings:** All functions, classes, and methods must have comprehensive docstrings. These should explain the purpose, arguments, and return values. Follow a consistent style (e.g., Google style).
    *   **Inline Comments:** Use inline comments sparingly for complex or non-obvious logic. Comments should explain *why* something is done, not *what* is done.
*   **Testing:**
    *   **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** While not strictly enforced, the principle of writing tests alongside implementation is encouraged to ensure correctness and prevent regressions.
    *   **Unit Tests:** Each module or function should have unit tests to verify its behavior in isolation.
*   **Security:**
    *   **Input Validation:** Never trust external data. Validate and sanitize all inputs (e.g., from data files, user-facing UI components) to prevent errors and security vulnerabilities.
    *   **No Hardcoded Secrets:** Never store sensitive information like API keys or credentials directly in the source code. Use environment variables or a secure secret management system.
