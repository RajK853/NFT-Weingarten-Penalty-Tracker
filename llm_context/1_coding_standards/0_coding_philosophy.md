# Coding Philosophy

This document outlines the key philosophical and general design principles guiding the project's development.

## 1. Python-Specific Philosophy

These principles are central to writing effective and "Pythonic" code.

*   **The Zen of Python (PEP 20):** The guiding philosophy of Python. Key tenets include:
    *   *Readability counts.*
    *   *Simple is better than complex.*
    *   *Explicit is better than implicit.*
*   **Write "Pythonic" Code:** Utilize Python's features and idioms as they are intended.
    *   **Examples:** Use list comprehensions, context managers (`with` statements), and dictionary/set lookups for efficiency and clarity.
*   **Duck Typing:** Focus on an object's behavior, not its type. If an object has the required methods and properties, it can be used. This promotes flexibility.

## 2. General Software Design Principles

These are universal principles that lead to better software architecture.

*   **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Prioritize simplicity. Avoid unnecessary complexity, as simple code is easier to understand, debug, and maintain.
*   **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoid code duplication. Encapsulate and reuse logic in functions, classes, or modules.
*   **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each module, class, or function should have one, and only one, reason to change. It should have a single, well-defined purpose.
*   **YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It):** Do not add functionality until it is actually needed. This keeps the codebase lean and focused.
*   **Principle of Least Astonishment (POLA):** A component of a system should behave in a way that users expect. The behavior should not be surprising or astonishing.
*   **Composition Over Inheritance:** Favor composing objects from smaller, single-responsibility components rather than creating complex inheritance hierarchies. This leads to more flexible and decoupled designs.
