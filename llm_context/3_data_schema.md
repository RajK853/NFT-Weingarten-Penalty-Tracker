# Data Schema

The application uses data from a Google Sheet (for the male team) or a local CSV (`data/pseudo_penalty.csv`) as a fallback.

## Key Columns

*   `Date`: The date of the shootout.
*   `Shooter Name`: The name of the player.
*   `Keeper Name`: The name of the goalkeeper.
*   `Status`: The outcome of the shot (`goal`, `saved`, or `out`).
